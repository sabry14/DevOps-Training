# Build Tools with Gradle

This repository demonstrates a complete **Gradle workflow** for building and running a Java application. The steps include cloning the source code, running unit tests, packaging the application, and running it.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Ibrahim-Adel15/build2.git](https://github.com/Ibrahim-Adel15/build2.git)
cd build2
Step 2: Run Unit Test
Execute the unit tests for the project:

Bash

./gradlew test
Step 3: Package the Application
Assemble the project and create the JAR file:

Bash

./gradlew build
Step 4: Run the Application
Execute the application:

Bash

./gradlew run

**Note:** Just make sure your image files are named `clone.png`, `test.png`, `build.png`, and `run.png` for them to show up.

**Would you like me to show you how to rename your images to match this file?**
